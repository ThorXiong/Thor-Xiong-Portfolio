								<p>Hello! I am Thor Xiong. I am currently a senior at Augsburg University studying computer science applied. I love making to music and I love the my family even more, I think that they are everything to me. I was in heavily in sports back in High School and 
									those skills and experiences have forever shaped me. I enjoy nature and its beauty. I understand that everyone seem to do too but I think its something I'm not doing enough, especailly with my love ones.</p>
								<p>Right now finding a job can be difficult especially for people with my major. Yet, I have hopeful eyes and ears knowing that I can continue to learn and find a place in this industry. I hope to work and gain expereinces, the good and the bad, to beome the best version
								that I can be.</p>

								<p>I've worked as a Sales Associate at Kohls Maplewood, MN. I've worked with lots of people of different backgrounds as customers and as co-workers, some I still am friends to this day. I've answered probably hundreds of calls and served even more customers in person. Dealt with emotional and uncooperating individuals to meeting some of the most nicest all in one setting, that is wild. Furthermore, I have been in many departments, ones that I haven't even signed up for too. From shoes to kitchen, toys to home decor, I probably was tasked to do almost everything that kohls has me to do on a sales level.
								I think that the experienes I've gain from this job was phenomenal. From the customer service experience to the frinds I made, all of them were things that I think has changed me for the better even if at the time it was challenging and possibly uncomfortable.</p>
								<p>I'm looking forward to volunteering at a technology recycling store by Minneapolis for experience and to meet some school requirements. Undoubtedly it seems like it'll be a rewarding and fun jounrey.</p>

								<p>As mentioned I am a computer science applied major. I've took courses in python, java, programming for data science, data structures, security, to name majority. I've also taken some fun classes like design, pixel and vectors, and screen printing(well still taking it as of this writing). Classes like communications and macroeconomics was quite interesting and taught me some useful skills I wouldn't have looked at if I haven't taken them.
								There is so many great classes that I have just now started to see. Yet, I am a senior and will not be able to partake in all of them unfortunately. While you are in your early years of school, you never really realize how cool some of these courses are and what you can learn. I love to learn and be able to work with anyone I come across and I hope to work with you.</p>
